Title : Ready to deploy feature Portal - Ankit 

We want to create a feature tracker portal with the following key features. 

Document Tracking and Status Management:
Provide a checklist for required documents, including:
Technical Design Document
Dev-Testing Document
PRs Reviewed
QA Testing Document
Pre- and Post-Deployment Documents
Sanity Testing/Staging Results
Status indicators for each step (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Completed).
Restrict progression to the next step until the current step is marked as completed by the designated owner.
Automated notifications to the next owner when their task is ready to begin. (optional)
Enable reassignment of owners if needed.
Approval Management:
Include specific approval checkpoints for key stakeholders, such as:
Product Go-Ahead
Epic Owner Go-Ahead
Real-Time Dashboards
Provide a centralized view of progress for all features in the pipeline.
